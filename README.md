Modelling and examining different aspects of AirQuality with regards to ML.

The following repository contains a task I worked on where I developed a model to predict Ozone particles in the atmosphere based off of different attributes including Temperature, Solar Radiation and Wind. 

Different models were compared to determine which was most suitable. 

**To View my results of the work I did**, either open `Compiled.hmtl` containing the compiled version of my code, or the corresponding `.rmd` file for raw code.
